# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `html.nesting` reports content models the parser accepts but browsers mishandle: interactive elements inside interactive ones, block elements inside `<p>`, and nested `<a>` or `<button>`, each at the inner element's exact location with a fix hint (#244).
- `a11y.iframe-title` reports iframes with missing or blank titles, with source locations and a manual fix hint (#232).
- `html.obsolete` reports obsolete elements and presentational attributes (`<center>`, `<font>`, `<marquee>`, `align`, `bgcolor`, and similar) with exact source locations and CSS fix hints (#245).
- `seaworthy verify --timings` prints time per stage and per check to stderr. The report is unchanged, so default output stays deterministic (#216).
- `html.charset` reports pages with no character encoding declaration, or one declared after the first 1,024 bytes, with the exact location and a fix hint (#243).
- `social.twitter-card` reports pages without a usable Twitter card type, and cards that have no image and no Open Graph fallback (#61).
- `social.image-size` reports social preview images below the platform minimum dimensions or over the 5 MB limit, reading only images inside the built site (#61).
- `html.meta-refresh` reports `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` with a delay greater than 0 seconds, which moves people before they can read (WCAG 2.2.1) (#246).
